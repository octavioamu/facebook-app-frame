Facebook-app-frame
==================

Simple styled frame to simulate facebook tab apps

Go to the <a href="http://rawgithub.com/octavioamu/facebook-app-frame/master/index.html">DEMO</a> and write a url in the top input to see the site into the frame.

Because a psd is not the same, and deploy and app just to see if it is ok sucks... So now we have this little better way to test our work. BUT I need your help to make this idea better and a powerful tool.

##How to use

- You can test from here :) but if you are making and app maybe is better to clone the repo and use it local.

- Clone the git repo â€” <code>git clone https://github.com/octavioamu/facebook-app-frame.git</code> and use it local (better for working projects due an security policy using iframes to access localhost)

Write the app's url, you want to see inside de iframe, on the input of the top ( without http:// ) and then hit `enter`.
